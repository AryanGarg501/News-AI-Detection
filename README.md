An AI-powered tool called NewsAI was created to confirm the veracity of news reports.  It evaluates news from many sources, verifies the consistency and dependability of the material, and offers a confidence score on its veracity by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Transformers and other cutting-edge machine learning approaches.  The goal of this initiative is to combat the growing issue of online disinformation and fake news.
