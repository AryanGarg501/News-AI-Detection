News-AI-Detection 
An AI-powered tool called NewsAI was created to confirm the veracity of news reports.  It evaluates news from many sources, verifies the consistency and dependability of the material, and offers a confidence score on its veracity by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Transformers and other cutting-edge machine learning approaches.  The goal of this initiative is to combat the growing issue of online disinformation and fake news.
Objective:-
News verification is the process of evaluating news from several sources and assessing its veracity using AI and ML models.
 Integration of Multiple Sources: To verify the accuracy of the information, the system gathers news from several reliable sources.
 Model Comparison: Uses cutting-edge models like as BERT, GPT, T5, and others to validate news.
 Easy-to-use Interface: The system offers a verification score based on AI analysis, and users can enter text or news URLs.
